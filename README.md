# Assignment3_Python
# Factorial and Math Operations

This repository contains two Python scripts that perform mathematical computations:

1. Task_1(3) - A function that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.
2. Task_2(3)- A program that takes user input and computes the square root, natural logarithm, and sine of the given number.

## Task 1: Factorial Calculation

### Description
The script `Task_1(3).py` defines a function to compute the factorial of a number recursively. It then calls the function with a sample number and prints the result.




## Task 2: Using the Math Module

### Description
The script `Task_2(3)` prompts the user to enter a number and then calculates:
- The square root
- The natural logarithm (base e)
- The sine (in radians)
